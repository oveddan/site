title: "About me"
---

I'm a developer, artist, and masters candidate at [ITP](https://itp.nyu.edu/itp/) in NYU. With the support of of the [Google Faculty Research Award](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2018/january/itp-professor-daniel-shiffman-granted-google-faculty-research-aw.html) granted to Daniel Shiffman, I work on open-sourcing machine learning models and making them assessible as a tool for artists, creative coders, and those new to programming.

I come from a full-stack programming background, but it would be challenging to label what I do as Iâ€™d consider myself a generalist.  In addition to **machine learning,** I'm into
**hardware,** **analog modular synthesis,** and **fabrication**.  I aim to make projects that take a digital input and generate a physical, analog output such as kinetic motion or sound.

I've worked with the [Google Creative Lab](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/), [SYPartners](https://www.sypartners.com/), and [10x Management](https://www.10xmanagement.com/meet-our-new-10xers/dan-oved/).
