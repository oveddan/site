title: "About Dan"
---

Iâ€™m an artist, engineer, and tool-maker creating new forms of live performances, musical instruments, and interactive space.

I am excited by the possibility of working in a space where physical and technical constraints are lifted so creative work can be expressed in new ways, and experienced collectively anywhere in the world.

I'm an adjunct, former resident researcher and graduate of [ITP](https://itp.nyu.edu/) in NYU. I've worked as a Computer Vision Engineer at the New York Times, and with the [Google Creative Lab](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/), and [SYPartners](https://www.sypartners.com/).
