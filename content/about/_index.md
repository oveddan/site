I’m Dan Oved, residing in Brooklyn and hailing originally from Los Angeles, 
currently doing my masters at ITP in New York University.
I come from a computer science and full-stack programming background,
and ever since getting bored with building online checkout flows and REST APIs I’ve been taking on creative projects.
This includes a [gamified and interactive spinning class](/portfolio/pursuit-by-equinox),
a series of [audio-reactive visualizations](/portfolio/audial-reality) in the browser,
and a 5-foot long bow full of LEDs that generates an image when twirled at the right speed.

![This is me][1]

It would be challenging to label what I do as I’d consider myself a generalist.
Recently I’ve expanded horizontally into [computer vision](blog/tags/computer-vision/),
[physical devices](/blog/tags/hardware/), and [fabrication](/blog/tags/fabrication/).
I’ve been grateful to be able to combine my background with this new knowledge to
make such things as the [Voronoi Cellular Zoetrope](https://vimeo.com/239159794),
a physical infinite animation generated by computer graphics shaders.
This past winter, I created [Presence](portfolio/presence/),
a kinetic sculpture that was controlled by a viewer’s eyes;
the gaze was detected using a pre-trained neural network and a web camera.

I’m excited to be working at the intersection of creativity and technology
at a time when the abundance of powerful GPUs on the edge,
innovation in digital fabrication tools, and advancing capabilities
of the browser enable us to to create rich experiences that are accessible to many people.
