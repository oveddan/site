I'm a developer, artist and masters candidate at [ITP](https://itp.nyu.edu/itp/) in NYU.
I come from a full-stack programming background, but it would be challenging to label what I do as I’d consider myself a generalist.  My current focus lies in [computer vision](blog/tags/computer-vision/), 
[hardware](/blog/tags/hardware/), and [fabrication](/blog/tags/fabrication/).  I explore new forms of interactions that are unlocked with recent advances in artificial intelligence and hardware.

![This is me][1]

I’m excited to be working at the intersection of creativity and technology
at a time when the abundance of powerful GPUs on the edge,
innovation in digital fabrication tools, and advancing capabilities
of the browser enable us to to create rich experiences that are accessible to many people.  

I've worked with the [Google Creative Lab](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/), [SYPartners](https://www.sypartners.com/), and [10x Management](https://www.10xmanagement.com/meet-our-new-10xers/dan-oved/).
