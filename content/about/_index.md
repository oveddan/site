I'm a developer, artist, and masters candidate at [ITP](https://itp.nyu.edu/itp/) in NYU.
I come from a full-stack programming background, but it would be challenging to label what I do as I’d consider myself a generalist.  My current focus lies in [computer vision](blog/tags/computer-vision/), 
[hardware](/blog/tags/hardware/), and [fabrication](/blog/tags/fabrication/).  I explore creative uses of machine learning and ways to make it more accessible to artists and developers.

![This is me][1]

I’m excited to be working at the intersection of creativity and technology
at a time when the abundance of powerful GPUs on the edge,
innovation in digital fabrication tools, and advancing capabilities
of the browser enable us to to create rich experiences that are accessible to many people.  

I've worked with the [Google Creative Lab](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/), [SYPartners](https://www.sypartners.com/), and [10x Management](https://www.10xmanagement.com/meet-our-new-10xers/dan-oved/).
