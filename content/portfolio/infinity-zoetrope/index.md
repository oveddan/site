The infinity zoetrope blends reality with the imagination by transforming an analog form into something limitless.  It was performed at the Museum of the Moving Image for Shantell Martin's Drawing on Everything class. By capturing a rotating disk at the right framerate with digital means, an infinite loop can be extended into another dimension through colors and transformation.

This performance was done in collaboration with [Hadar ben Tzur](https://www.hadarbentzur.com/), to a poem by "Proof for the Existence of God" by Jorge Luis Borges.

Illustrations and readings were by Hadar.  Both generating the zoetrope discs, and playing them back was done in TouchDesigner by me.
