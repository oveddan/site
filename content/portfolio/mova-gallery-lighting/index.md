The [Mova Gallery](https://www.facebook.com/mova.gallery/) is an installation which features visionary art and 
appears at different festivals around the world.  During the Oregon Eclipse festival, it was built as a two-story
structure, and I was in charge of the lighting.

##### Role: Lighting

I was responsible for selecting the lighting and installing it. This included:

* PAR cans and flood lights
* DMX Controls
* Analog RGB leds hidden under the stage and the canopy to create a glowing effect.
