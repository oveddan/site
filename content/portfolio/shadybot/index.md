summary: The ShadyBot is an art car for the Robot Heart camp at Burning man.   It is shaped like a fish whos features provide a shady lounge and deck for spectactors, and at night has LEDs that project across its diffused surface. At the 2018 event, I helped build it, wire its LEDs, and was responsible for mapping and programming the visuals.

For the 2018 edition of Burning Man, I went a week early to help build three installations for the Robot Heart Camp:
an illuminated heart that sits atop the camps bus and was center of their parties, an art-car called shadybot shaped like a fish with high-density LEDs that would drive around the desert, and a massive logo shaped LED wall.
