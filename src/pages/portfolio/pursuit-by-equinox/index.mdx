##### Role: Lead Developer

##### Team Size: 6

##### Technologies: React, Redux, Node.js, RxJS, Three.js, glsl shaders, Websockets

I was the lead developer on a team that re-built the gaming and visualization platform from the ground up to be flexible and robust.
We converted it to use a single directional data-flow with redux on the server to centralize the state,
and react, three.js, and webgl on the client to render real-time visualizations.

The new platform reduced the time it takes to build and release a game from 4 to 1.5 months,
and decreased the time it took for data to reach the screens from the bikes from 2 seconds to 100 milliseconds.

I oversaw the release of 6 new games by external agencies using the new framework.
